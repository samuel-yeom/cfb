## Overview
A perennial debate in college football is whether the "best" teams should be ranked above the "most deserving" teams. Different models take different positions on this issue. Some, like [ESPN's FPI](http://www.espn.com/college-football/statistics/teamratings), attempt to find the true strength of teams in order to predict the results of future games. Others, such as [Colley](https://www.colleyrankings.com), reward teams for their wins and penalize them for their losses. This ranking is an attempt at combining these two approaches to get something that resembles human polls ([AP](https://collegefootball.ap.org/poll), [Coaches](http://sportspolls.usatoday.com/ncaa/football/polls/coaches-poll), [CFP](http://collegefootballplayoff.com/rankings.aspx)). Here are the ways in which this ranking differs from human polls:

* **Very little consideration for margin of victory.** While the margin of victory is useful for determining which teams are "better", the goal of a football game is to win, not to lose by as few points as possible. This ranking uses margin of victory only indirectly through FPI scores.
* **No recency bias.** Games have the same impact on a team's rating regardless of when they were played during the season.

At the beginning of the season, this ranking is identical to the FPI ranking, but as more games are played in the season, a team's record becomes much more important.
